# Time_Series_Forecast_Tools

OVERVIEW
As Stradigi AI time series group we would like to have state of the art algorithms able to do forecasting on time series. Gather from the literature the different algorithms that could be used as building blocks for a general pipeline for featurization and vectorization of inputs. 

GOALS
- Review literature on time series forecasting.
- Use the following 2 structured data sets to build train/test the solution:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data
https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data
- Plan/architect  and implement a pipeline based on the research done in the previous steps. Find algorithms for evaluation and implement them. 
- Provide a configurable pipeline that can forecast sales using any of the 2 structured data sets.
